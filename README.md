# Vaclav Hanzl

Spent most of my professional life ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-hanzl-326140199/), [CV+Publications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yfaq-PaX5DQuu6oqqKCoCS1OODi9G8fS7_soGNEnP5c/edit?usp=sharing)) in Speech Recognition doing acoustic and language models and creating highly optimized decoders for most types of hardware you can imagine (and likely for some you cannot).
Occasionally, I do various divertimento projects outside AI, like typesetting a Japanese [textbook](http://denisa.vostry.cz/ucebnice/) or software for a scary hydraulic machine or [web about my wife's books](http://denisa.vostry.cz/). 
I am fascinated by similarities in computer and living beings architectures ever since I realized that RNA is both software & hardware. Biochemistry is my life long hobby and since I found the [OpenFold project](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold), I am trying to learn biochemistry for real.


Fascinated by similarities in computer and living beings architectures ever since I realized that RNA is both software & hardware. Love opensource because successful opensource tends to be well designed.

Here is some free software I (mostly) wrote:
* [hacktrack: Move windows by four fingers on trackpad](https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/hacktrack) - I use it daily and frankly I love this feature and any computer without it feels broken :)
* [prak: Czech phonetic alignment tool](https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/prak) - this is my gift to people doing Czech phonetics. I also have it as a PyTorch playground. [Adléta](https://github.com/adletka) wrote the Praat script part (too scary for me) and carefully researched the user needs to make sure we do a useful thing.

You can <a rel="me" href="https://sigmoid.social/@vaclavh">find me at Mastodon</a>. (I still have Twitter but mostly do not use it anymore.) You can also find me on Printables - see my hot new [Molecules for protein folding](https://www.printables.com/model/457984-molecules-for-protein-folding)!
