# Vaclav Hanzl

Spent most of my [professional life](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-hanzl-326140199/) in Speech Recognition.
Occasionally, I do various divertimento projects outside AI, like typesetting a Japanese [textbook](http://denisa.vostry.cz/ucebnice/) or software for a scary hydraulic machine or [web about my wife's books](http://denisa.vostry.cz/).
