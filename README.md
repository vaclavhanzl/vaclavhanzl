# Vaclav Hanzl

Spent most of my [professional life](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-hanzl-326140199/) in Speech Recognition doing acoustic and language models and creating highly optimized decoders for most types of hardware you can imagine (and likely for some you cannot).
Occasionally, I do various divertimento projects outside AI, like typesetting a Japanese [textbook](http://denisa.vostry.cz/ucebnice/) or software for a scary hydraulic machine or [web about my wife's books](http://denisa.vostry.cz/). Fascinated by similarities in computer and living beings architectures ever since I realized that RNA is both software & hardware. Love opensource because successful opensource tends to be well designed.

Here is some free software I (mostly) wrote:
* [hacktrack: Move windows by four fingers on trackpad](https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/hacktrack) - I use it daily and frankly I love this feature and any computer without it feels broken :)
* [prak: Czech phonetic alignment tool](https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/prak) - this is my gift to people doing Czech phonetics. I also have it as a PyTorch playground. [Adléta](https://github.com/adletka) wrote the Praat sctipt part (too scary for me) and carefully researched user needs to make sure we do a useful thing.
